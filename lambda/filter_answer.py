class Filter:
    """
    The filter function in Python constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a provided function returns True.

    Parameters:
        function: A function that returns True or False for each element.
        iterable: An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose elements are tested.

    Returns:
        An iterator yielding only those elements for which the function returns True.

    Example:
        filter(lambda x: x > 0, [-1, 0, 1, 2]) yields 1, 2.
        To get a list, use list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, [-1, 0, 1, 2])) which returns [1, 2].

    """
    Returns a list of even numbers from self.numbers.

    Uses the built-in filter function with a lambda that checks if each number is divisible by 2 (x % 2 == 0).
    Only numbers for which the lambda returns True (i.e., even numbers) are included in the result.
