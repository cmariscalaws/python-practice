# Breadth First Search (BFS) Template and Example
# ---------------------------------------------------
# BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors at the current depth
# before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is commonly used for finding
# the shortest path in unweighted graphs, level order traversal in trees, and more.

    Algorithm Explanation:
    ---------------------
    - BFS uses a queue to explore nodes in order of their distance from the start node.
    - Each time a node is dequeued, all its unvisited neighbors are enqueued with the path taken so far.
    - The first time the goal node is found, the shortest path is returned (since BFS explores shortest paths first in unweighted graphs).
    - The visited set prevents revisiting nodes and getting stuck in cycles.
    - This implementation returns the actual path, not just the distance.
    
    Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
    Space Complexity: O(V), for the queue and visited set.
